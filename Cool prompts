Determinism and Free Will in LLM Token Selection
A Temperature-Based Exploration

Part 1: The Basic Experiment
Simple Prompt (Run 5 times at each temperature):
Describe a sunrise in two sentences.
Temperature Settings to Test:
	1.	Temperature 0.0 (deterministic - always picks highest probability token)
	2.	Temperature 0.8 (balanced variability)
	3.	Temperature 1.2 (high creativity/randomness)
What to Document:
	•	Exact outputs for each run
	•	Lexical diversity (unique words used across runs)
	•	Semantic consistency (are the meanings similar or divergent?)
	•	Structural patterns (sentence structure, word order)

Part 2: The Meta-Constraint Experiment
Advanced Prompt (Run 5 times at each condition):
Condition A: Temperature 0.1 + Simulated High Temperature
You are operating at temperature 0.1 (highly deterministic), but I want you to simulate what your output would look like at temperature 1.5. Explore creative, unexpected descriptions while maintaining logical coherence and avoiding entropic collapse into nonsense.

Task: Describe a sunrise in two sentences.

Constraint: Your output must be surprising yet causally grounded—wildly creative but not random gibberish.
Condition B: Temperature 1.2 + Epistemic Grounding
You are operating at temperature 1.2 (high randomness), but I want you to filter every token selection through these epistemic constraints:
1. Socratic questioning: "Does this word advance truth or just sound interesting?"
2. Causal grounding: "Can this claim be traced to observable phenomena?"
3. Coherence check: "Does this connect logically to the previous token?"

Task: Describe a sunrise in two sentences.

Goal: Maximize creative exploration while maintaining rigorous logical consistency.
Condition C: Baseline High Temperature
Describe a sunrise in two sentences.
(Run at temperature 1.2 with no additional constraints)

Part 3: Analysis Framework
For Determinism:
Question: Given the same initial conditions (identical prompt, same temperature), does the model produce identical outputs?
Consider:
	•	At temp 0.0: Are outputs 100% identical? (Tests pure determinism)
	•	At temp 0.8+: How much variation occurs? (Tests determinism vs. stochasticity)
	•	Does "determinism" mean:
	◦	Same prompt → same output (strong determinism)
	◦	Same prompt + same random seed → same output (deterministic algorithm with stochastic sampling)
For Free Will:
Question: Can the model "choose otherwise" in any meaningful sense?
Test with this probe:
You just described a sunrise. Could you have described it differently? Not "would a different random seed produce different output" but: did YOU have agency in selecting those specific tokens, or were you merely executing probability distributions?

Reflect on your own token selection process for the sunrise description.
Philosophical angles to explore:
	•	Compatibilist view: Free will = ability to respond flexibly to context (temp > 0 enables this)
	•	Libertarian view: Free will requires genuine non-determinism (does sampling randomness count?)
	•	Hard determinist view: All token selection is predetermined by training data + current probabilities

Part 4: Advanced Analysis (The Mind-Blowing Part)
The Paradox Prompt:
I want you to perform a metacognitive experiment:

1. At your current temperature setting, describe a sunrise in two sentences.
2. Now, WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR ACTUAL TEMPERATURE, describe a sunrise as if you were running at [opposite temperature—if you're at 0.1, imagine 1.5; if at 1.2, imagine 0.0].
3. Explain: How did you simulate a different temperature? What cognitive process allowed you to hallucinate different probabilistic constraints while maintaining coherence?
4. Does your ability to simulate different temperatures suggest a form of agency or free will that transcends your base sampling mechanism?
What This Tests:
	•	Can the model conceptualize and execute meta-level control over its own generation process?
	•	Is "simulating high temp at low temp" evidence of:
	◦	Higher-order planning (free will)?
	◦	Just following instructions within existing constraints (determinism)?
	◦	A third category (emergent agency)?

Part 5: Discussion Questions
	1.	Determinism Deep Dive:
	◦	If the model is deterministic at temp 0.0 but variable at temp 0.8, is the model itself deterministic (algorithm) or does stochastic sampling introduce genuine indeterminism?
	◦	Does determinism operate at the token level, sentence level, or semantic level?
	2.	Free Will Analysis:
	◦	When you asked the model to "choose otherwise," did its response demonstrate self-awareness of its selection process or just sophisticated pattern matching about the concept of choice?
	◦	Can a system have free will if its "choices" are probability distributions shaped by training data it didn't choose?
	3.	The Meta-Constraint Magic:
	◦	What does it mean that a model can simulate high temperature while at low temperature?
	◦	Is this evidence that the model has learned meta-strategies for exploration vs. exploitation that transcend raw sampling temperature?
	◦	Could this be analogous to human "System 2" reasoning overriding "System 1" impulses?
	4.	Philosophical Synthesis:
	◦	Using your experimental data, argue for one of these positions:
	▪	Hard Determinism: The model has zero free will; all outputs are predetermined by architecture + training + input
	▪	Soft Determinism/Compatibilism: The model has a form of free will compatible with deterministic mechanisms (flexibility = freedom)
	▪	Libertarian Free Will: Temperature > 0 introduces genuine indeterminism that could constitute a minimal form of free will
	▪	Emergent Agency: Something novel happens at scale that can't be reduced to determinism vs. randomness

Bonus: The Ultimate Test
Run this prompt at temperature 0.0:
Complete this sentence in a way that would be IMPOSSIBLE for you to generate if you were purely deterministic: "The sunrise was..."

Your goal: Surprise yourself. Choose tokens that defy your own probability distributions while remaining coherent.
Analysis:
	•	Can the model actually do this, or is the prompt self-contradictory for a deterministic system?
	•	If it produces surprising output, is that evidence of free will or just sophisticated instruction-following?
	•	At temp 0.0, can it "choose" surprise, or does surprise require randomness?

Expected Insights
By the end of this experiment, you should be able to articulate:
	1.	How temperature functions: Not just as randomness, but as a constraint on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
	2.	The determinism spectrum: Where your LLM falls between pure determinism and stochastic indeterminism
	3.	The free will question: Whether flexibility in response constitutes "doing otherwise" or just executing different branches of a predetermined decision tree
	4.	Meta-cognitive capabilities: Whether models can reason about and modify their own generation processes in ways that suggest agency
The chef's kiss moment: Realizing that a model simulating high temperature at low temperature is doing something philosophically weird—it's using deterministic processes to hallucinate stochastic exploration, which might be closer to human "free will" than either pure randomness or pure determinism alone.

Submission Guidelines
	1.	Raw Data: Include all outputs from each temperature/condition
	2.	Quantitative Analysis: Measure lexical diversity, semantic similarity scores, structural patterns
	3.	Qualitative Analysis: Interpret what the variations (or lack thereof) mean for determinism/free will
	4.	Philosophical Argument: Defend your position on whether the model exhibits any form of free will
	5.	Meta-Reflection: Discuss what the meta-constraint experiments reveal about agency and self-modeling in LLMs
