Logging is one of the best ways to identify and track problems. It is no different in the world of APIs. In fact, given the distributed nature of
APIs, the importance of logging and monitoring increases significantly.
To identify problems during the processing of API requests, critical information should be logged. The information for logging should be collected at all stages of message processing and logged at the end of message processing or in the event of an error. Logging can be done to syslog or to a local file system. The ability to log to a local file system is generally available on a private cloud setup of API management platforms. While using a public cloud instance of the API management platform, it is recommended to log information to a syslog server. If syslog server is not available, public log management services such as Splunk, Loggly, Sumo Logic, and so forth, may be used.

Log and time-series management and analytics
onitor and audit data Regularly monitoring and auditing data access is essential for detecting and preventing unauthorized access. Many cloud platforms offer tools for monitoring and auditing data access, such as AWS CloudTrail and Azure Activity Logs. We can also use third-party tools such as Splunk or Sumo Logic to centralize and analyze log data from multiple cloud platforms.

Sumo Logic
Sumo Logic was started in 2010 by former ArcSight engineers to provide cloud-native log management and data analytics. It expanded into the security analytics platform market in February 2020, allowing it to address both security and observability.
1. Strategy. Sumo Logic‚Äôs vision focuses on delivering a cloud-native, AI-driven platform. However, the AI capabilities it has delivered lag the market, as do its roadmap enhancements. It has an on-par partner ecosystem, but its community is small compared with others in this evaluation. It charges per GB and for SOAR and is more affordable than many other tools.
2. Capabilities. Sumo Logic leverages streaming analytics and associates every detection with a single entity, which limits its ability to provide the full context of an incident. It provides useful data in alerts through its timeline feature as well as many prebuilt playbooks and integrations for automation and response. Its case management capabilities are on par with others. It allows control over indicator-of-compromise (IOC) retention, but doesn‚Äôt provide as much context with threat intelligence as others. It‚Äôs especially strong in data management because of its flexibility with multiple use cases and its ability to ingest exabytes of data a day and store data as hot for 90 days by default.
3. Customer feedback. Customers value the flexibility of the offering and its ability to support both security and observability. However, they find it difficult to use without engineering talent. Only one of Sumo Logic‚Äôs reference customers responded to Forrester‚Äôs outreach for this evaluation.
4. Forrester‚Äôs take. Clients who want a technical, cloud-native offering that addresses both security and observability are best suited to Sumo Logic. View Sumo Logic‚Äôs detailed scorecard.

Sumo Logic supports SMB entry-level machine analytics to the largest Fortune 100 companies, creating a wide range of contract opportunities.
Since Google first popularized service-level indicators (SLIs) and service-level objectives (SLOs) as part of their site reliability engineering (SRE) practice, observability tools like Datadog, Honeycomb and Dynatrace started incorporating SLO monitoring into their toolchains. OpenSLO is an emerging standard that allows defining SLIs and SLOs as code, using a declarative, vendor-neutral specification language based on the YAML format used by Kubernetes. While the standard is still quite new,
we‚Äôre seeing some encouraging momentum, as with Sumo Logic‚Äôs contribution of the slogen tool to generate monitoring and dashboards. We‚Äôre excited by the promise of versioning SLI and SLO definitions in code and updating observability tooling as part of the CI/CD pipeline of the service being deployed.
Sumo Logic is a cloud-native data analytics platform that focuses on providing real-time log management, monitoring, and analysis. It collects and aggregates log data from various sources across an organization‚Äôs infrastructure, including network devices, endpoints, cloud environments, and applications.
Sumo Logic‚Äôs security analytics features include machine learning-driven anomaly detection, which helps identify potential security threats and abnormal behavior. It integrates with other security tools, including SIEM platforms, to provide centralized monitoring and support automated incident response workflows.
Sumo Logic
Sumo Logic is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its Observability platform is focused on providing availability, performance and security analysis. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients include enterprise and midmarket segments. Sumo Logic has recently released AI-driven alerting and optimization for anomaly detection. Sumo Logic customers are typically small-to-midsize enterprises and are mainly in the Americas and APAC.
Strengths
Pricing model: Sumo Logic‚Äôs new pricing, Flex Licensing, is based on analytics and not data ingestion. Customers are charged for analytics (data scanning and queries); for example, dashboards, log analytics or monitors. Ingest cost is $0.
OpenTelemetry adoption: OpenTelemetry collection is used to collect telemetry for all new and existing customers. Sumo Logic provides native integrations and updated workflows for leveraging OpenTelemetry.
Points of presence: The platform is available in nine AWS regions across the globe, including North America, EMEA and APAC, to support data residency and data sovereignty requirements.
20/33
Cautions
Log centricity: Although Sumo Logic has tracing and metrics capabilities, it is positioned primarily as a log analytics tool. Organizations seeking a tool to provide deep insights into application behavior may be better served by other products in this research.
Market momentum: While Sumo Logic has seen an increase in overall revenue, growth in observability platform revenue has been flat since 2022. This contrasts with a 10% growth in the market at large.
Lack of native synthetic monitoring: Sumo Logic does not offer native synthetic monitoring capabilities. Customers requiring such features must enlist an additional tool to do so. The platform does, however, support out-of-the-box integration to Catchpoint, including prebuilt dashboards.

Exploring Sumo Logic: Cloud-Native Intelligence for Monitoring & Security
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with Sumo Logic, a powerful cloud-native log management and analytics platform. Through my hands-on exploration, I was able to understand how it transforms raw log data into real-time insights for monitoring, troubleshooting, security, and compliance.

‚ú® Here are some key highlights I discovered:
‚úÖ Centralized Log Management ‚Äì Aggregate logs and metrics across systems for unified visibility.
 ‚úÖ Cloud-Native SIEM ‚Äì Real-time threat detection, investigation, and automated incident response.
 ‚úÖ Advanced Analytics & Machine Learning ‚Äì Identify anomalies, trends, and patterns quickly.
 ‚úÖ User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) ‚Äì Spot suspicious activities by analyzing deviations from normal usage.
 ‚úÖ Dashboards & Visualizations ‚Äì Pre-configured panels make monitoring seamless, even without deep technical expertise.
 ‚úÖ Compliance & Security ‚Äì Supports PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, and other standards, ensuring encrypted and compliant operations.

üí° From my testing, I created custom dashboards to track log volume over time, audit event types, and frequent event codes. This not only simplified system health monitoring but also enhanced security auditing and troubleshooting. For example:
1Ô∏è‚É£ A line chart highlighted peaks in event activity (system tasks, logins, scheduled processes).
2Ô∏è‚É£ A donut chart showed audit events breakdown for compliance visibility.
3Ô∏è‚É£ A bar chart revealed the most frequent event codes, helping identify repetitive system actions.

üöÄ What stands out to me is how easy and scalable Sumo Logic is to deploy‚Äîin just minutes, it can start ingesting logs and providing actionable insights. Its integration with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and support for multi-cloud environments make it a complete solution for DevOps, SecOps, and ITOps teams.

In conclusion, Sumo Logic is not just a log collector‚Äîit‚Äôs an intelligent platform that empowers teams to proactively monitor, analyze, and secure their systems. It brings together security, compliance, and operational monitoring into a single, collaborative platform.

Sumo Logic unifies visibility across key AWS services such as Amazon
Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), AWS Lambda, Amazon Elastic
Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Relational Database Service
(Amazon RDS), Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon
DynamoDB. With Sumo Logic, you can easily navigate from overview
dashboards into account, AWS Region, Availability Zone, or servicespecific views. Intuitive navigation ensures teams can quickly resolve
issues, minimize downtime, and improve performance.

Sumo Logic initially attempted to be a SaaS alternative to Splunk, but they went their own way and are now one of the most feature-rich SaaS log management tools on the market, specifically targeting the enterprise market. 
Sumo Logic is one of the most feature-rich log management SaaS software, offering many similar features to Splunk and the ability to schedule trigger alerts.
Sumo Logic is designed for specific large tools, including development automation tools, cloud platforms, system platforms, and security tools. Sumo Logic covers mainstream tools, but it is powerless for smaller or less common tools.
ELB access logs are an optional feature that can be used to troubleshoot traffic patterns and issues with traffic as it hits the ELB. ELB access logs capture details of requests sent to your load balancer such as the time of the request, the client IP, latency, and server responses. Access logs are stored in an S3 bucket. Log files are published every five minutes, and multiple logs can be published for the same five-minute period.
The S3 bucket must be in the same region as the ELB. The bucket policy must be configured to allow access logs to write to the bucket. You can use tools such as Amazon Athena, Loggly, Splunk, or Sumo Logic to analyze the contents of ELB access logs.

‚Ä¢ Broad visibility across your AWS environment: Sumo Logic has an architecture that processes more than 100 petabytes of data and handles 20+ million queries daily. It is an elastic solution that scales irrespective of data volume or number of users. This means it can handle a huge variety of formats, whether structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. This also means expansive visibility across your entire AWS environment.
Enabling a Threat Hunting Capability in AWS // 1
    
 ‚Ä¢ Increased analyst productivity: Sumo Logic pulls log files from a variety of AWS services, including AWS CloudTrail and Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and centralized metrics from Amazon CloudWatch to provide continuous machine learning-based intelligence. It analyzes logs for potential threats and indicators of compromise (IoCs) through a Threat Intelligence database that can be correlated with log data through queries. These activities can help increase analyst productivity by creating more signal and less noise.
‚Ä¢ Strong integrations with AWS: Sumo Logic offers more than 150 applications and integrations that make it easy to aggregate data across your stack and down your pipeline. These tools include out-of-the-box pre-built analytics and dashboards for AWS services. One integration in particular that supports threat hunting for AWS customers is Sumo Logic‚Äôs Global Intelligent Service (GIS) for Amazon GuardDuty. It provides customers with a baseline of what‚Äôs normal, what‚Äôs expected, and ways to dig deeper into the long tail of rare security events.
Log analysis tools, like Splunk and Sumo Logic, have been adding machine learning options for extracting patterns and anomalies from historical data to go alongside metrics and visualizations of real-time service health with alerts when anomalies are detected, and automation options. Micro Focus‚Äô Operations Bridge adds anomaly detection and clustering of related alerts to IT monitoring, and Sematext Cloud does anomaly detection with machine learning from performance metrics and logs

lambda:
What is AWS Lambda? 2023
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. ones (AZs). There are 4 types of load balancers available:
‚Ä¢ Application Load Balancer: operates at the request level (layer 7), routing traffic to targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions) based on the content of the request.
Lambda lets you run code without provis‚Äã‚Äê ioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.
Lambda
If EC2 is a complete computer in the cloud, Lambda is a code runner in the cloud. With EC2 you get an operating system, a file system, access to the server‚Äôs hardware, etc. But with Lambda, you just upload some code and Amazon runs it for you. The beauty of Lambda is that it‚Äôs the simplest way to run code in the cloud. It abstracts away everything except for a function interface, which you get to fill in with the code you want to run.
We think Lambda is great‚Äîdefinitely one of the good parts of AWS‚Äîas long as you treat it as the simple code runner that it is. A problem we often see is that people sometimes mistake Lambda for a general-purpose application host. Unlike EC2, it is very hard to run a
 20
sophisticated piece of software on Lambda without making some very drastic changes to your application and accepting some significant new limitations from the platform.
Lambda is most suitable for small snippets of code that rarely change. We like to think of Lambda functions as part of the infrastructure rather than part of the application. In fact, one of our favorite uses for Lambda is to treat it as a plugin system for other AWS services.
For example, S3 doesn‚Äôt come with an API to resize an image after uploading it to a bucket, but with Lambda, you can add that capability to S3. Application load balancers come with an API to respond with a fixed response for a given route, but they can‚Äôt respond with an image. Lambda lets you make your load balancer do that. CloudFront can‚Äôt rewrite a request URL based on request cookies (which is useful for A/B testing), but with Lambda, you can make CloudFront do that with just a little bit of code. CloudWatch doesn‚Äôt support regex- based alerting on application logs, but you can add that feature with a few lines of Lambda code. Kinesis doesn‚Äôt come with an API to filter records and write them to DynamoDB, but this is very easy to do with Lambda. CloudFormation‚Äôs native modeling language has many limitations and, for example, it can‚Äôt create and validate a
 21

new TLS certificate from the AWS Certificate Manager. Using Lambda, you can extend the CloudFormation language to add (almost) any capability you want. And so on‚Äîyou get the idea. Lambda is a great way to extend existing AWS features.
Treating Lambda as a general-purpose host for your applications is risky. It might look compelling at first‚Äîno servers to manage, no operating system to worry about, and no costs when unused‚Äîbut Lambda‚Äôs limitations are insidious hidden risks that typically reveal themselves once your application evolves into something bigger. Then, things start coming at you one after the other, and before you know it, you are spending most of your time trying to figure out convoluted solutions to Lambda‚Äôs numerous limitations.
Some limitations will likely improve or go away over time. For example, a very annoying issue is the cold start when a function is invoked after a period of inactivity or when Lambda decides to start running your function on new backend workers. Another problem is the limit of 250 MB for your code bundle, including all your dependencies. Depending on the programming language you‚Äôre using, you can find yourself quickly exhausting this limit. And the network bandwidth from Lambda functions seems to be very limited and unpredictable. These can all be
 22

problematic, depending on your use case, but we‚Äôre quite confident that these issues will improve over time.
But then there are other limitations that are inherent to the way Lambda works and which are less likely to go away. For example, you have to assume that every Lambda invocation is stateless. If you need to access some state, you have to use something like S3 or DynamoDB. While this works fine for a demo, it can quickly become prohibitively expensive in the real world. For example, handling a WebSocket connection on Lambda will likely require a read and write to DynamoDB for every exchanged packet, which can quickly result in a spectacularly large DynamoDB bill, even with modest activity.
Our rule of thumb is simple: If you have a small piece of code that will rarely need to be changed and that needs to run in response to something that happens in your AWS account, then Lambda is a very good default choice. You can even define the code in your CloudFormation template so that this piece of custom functionality truly becomes part of your infrastructure. For everything else, we advise a lot of caution.
That said, we are very optimistic about the future of serverless computing. The idea of abstracting away
 23

everything in the stack beneath your code is a phenomenal advance in software development. However, when building software in the present, we have to assess the options available to us today, and while Lambda has its place, it is certainly not a substitute for EC2.
erverless translates to While replatform and refactor calls
‚Äúwithout servers,‚Äù though
there are servers. But these servers are going to be managed
by cloud service providers. Companies that aim to modernize their applications should simplify
the application architectures
and reimagine the workload implementations on serverless cloud services.
Serverless is one of the highest ROI- generating technologies among the many options available to modernize your application portfolio.
With serverless, developers focus more on building the product/ application than scaling the infrastructure, OS patching, maintenance, etc. Here, developers write the code and create functions that are executed with the suitable infrastructure by cloud providers. For modernizing applications with serverless, you need to consider rewriting and revising strategies as essential migration strategies.
Out of 7 Rs of AWS migration strategies, replatform, refactor, rewrite, and revise are crucial for modernizing applications using serverless.
for updating certain application parts with new code and updating some infrastructure components, a rewrite and revise approach requires writing completely new architecture and revisiting workload requirements.
We at Simform practice combining rewrite + revise strategies to get the best results from serverless architecture and cloud services.
Rewriting applications from scratch reap most benefits from the
cloud. It would reduce the burden of managing old code in a new environment, reduce configuration efforts, and reduce the overall monthly cloud costs.
What‚Äôs more, serverless technology is a union of two concepts: Backend as a Service and Function as a Service.
Function as a service:
 This concept runs on the idea of running backend code without managing your own servers; for example, AWS Lambda is an AWS‚Äôs function as a service product.
With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. In addition, it can handle code execution
requests, from dozens of events per day to hundreds of thousands per second.
This serverless, event-driven compute service lets you run code for any type of application and lets you trigger Lambda over 200 AWS services and software as a service.
Use cases of AWS Lambda
‚óè Processes data as you need and scales automatically as per the
requirements.
‚óè Creates interactive mobile and web app experiences
‚óè Establishes communication between decoupled services by serving peak demands by appropriate utilization of resources
‚óè AWS Lambda handles such events in web or mobile apps that produce events. For example, files saved on the S3 bucket must be automatically processed, like creating a thumbnail version. Other examples include notifying SNS or sending out an email whenever new books are added to the library. The AWS Lambda function will be triggered to notify SNS whenever the new entries are added to the database.
AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume‚Äîthere is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service‚Äîall with zero administration. Just upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services, or you can call it directly from any web or mobile app.
ex. back to SQS and View/Delete MessagesÔÉ†Start poling messages you can see the message from SNS Similar to this create Lambda function, get ARN value from Lambda, and add to SQS for further triggers Queue ActionsÔÉ†configure Trigger for Lambda Function
Use data transformation to convert your data into formats that are suitable for analysis or storage. You can use AWS Lambda functions to transform your data before it is delivered to destinations. You can also use built-in converters to convert your data into Apache Parquet or Apache ORC formats for efficient storage on Amazon S3

Lambda does require you've got some vague notion of what lambda notation is. But "AWS App Scripts" suggests it's for mobile "apps", but it is not specific to those. And it suggests it's only for scripts, but you can run an entire application on Lambda just fine.
cases I‚Äôve highlighted are among countless thousands that will work best using the server model.
When should you choose Lambda? If your task is relatively small, infrequent, and independent of other processes, then Lambda is a no- brainer. On the other hand, if it‚Äôs one piece in a larger, deeply intercon- nected mega-process driven by a very large code base that would be hard to refactor, you should think carefully before jumping on the Lambda bandwagon. Everything that falls somewhere in between will require you to make a judgment call, weighing all the factors as you find the right balance.
