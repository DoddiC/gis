Why GIS is crucial:
It helps understand risks spatially (like floods, droughts, or infrastructure exposure).
It enables smarter decisions about development, disaster response, and climate adaptation.
And most importantly — GIS transforms data into action.

GIS developer staff implement full life cycle management and version/release control on our GIS code apps with complete unit & integration testing and user acceptance testing. The code apps are also typically mixed code bases with the GIS code being supported by accessory and packaging code like .Net, PowerShell, DB SQL, JavaScript etc.

My Jupyter notebook that bangs up datasets and updates a GIS service with the results = analyst work.
Python is more like a CLI to a bunch of different programs, through the use of internal scripting for some programs and API or library usage for others.

So, if you're scripting a bunch of stuff together, I think of it as "kind of" programming, but if you're building out the underlying tools, libraries, frameworks, etc. I think "developer".

check QA and production server with all the connections
Copy all scripts from server 14 to server 16 as part of the server migration
Set up VIT (backup) scripts on the new servers - currently there's a survey backup script running on production server 14 that needs to be migrated
Fill out a format/request form that will be provided to raise a new job request for the VIT scripts through Adnan
Coordinate with Rakesh on the script migration tasks
