Why GIS is crucial:
It helps understand risks spatially (like floods, droughts, or infrastructure exposure).
It enables smarter decisions about development, disaster response, and climate adaptation.
And most importantly ‚Äî GIS transforms data into action.

GIS developer staff implement full life cycle management and version/release control on our GIS code apps with complete unit & integration testing and user acceptance testing. The code apps are also typically mixed code bases with the GIS code being supported by accessory and packaging code like .Net, PowerShell, DB SQL, JavaScript etc.

My Jupyter notebook that bangs up datasets and updates a GIS service with the results = analyst work.
Python is more like a CLI to a bunch of different programs, through the use of internal scripting for some programs and API or library usage for others.

So, if you're scripting a bunch of stuff together, I think of it as "kind of" programming, but if you're building out the underlying tools, libraries, frameworks, etc. I think "developer".

**Subject: Seeking Carpool Partners - Manteca to Oakland Office**

Hi PG&E Team,

Hope everyone's having a great day! I'm Destiny from the Vegetation Management side, reaching out to our community to see if anyone might be interested in carpooling from the Manteca area to our Oakland office.

I've been making the commute solo and thought it would be beneficial to connect with fellow colleagues who might be traveling the same route. Carpooling offers several advantages:

‚Ä¢ **Cost savings** on gas and bridge tolls
‚Ä¢ **Reduced environmental impact** - supporting PG&E's sustainability goals
‚Ä¢ **HOV lane access** for faster commute times
‚Ä¢ **Networking opportunity** with fellow team members
‚Ä¢ **Shared driving responsibility** to reduce fatigue

**What I'm looking for:**
- Reliable commute partners from Manteca or nearby areas (Stockton, Modesto, Tracy welcome too)
- Flexible schedule coordination for regular office days
- Professional, punctual individuals who value a positive commute experience

If this sounds appealing to you, or if you know someone who might be interested, please reach out! We can discuss schedules, cost-sharing arrangements, and logistics that work for everyone involved.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow commuters and making our daily journey more efficient and enjoyable.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

*Feel free to share this message with anyone in your network who might benefit from a carpool arrangement.*
