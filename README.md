GIS developer staff implement full life cycle management and version/release control on our GIS code apps with complete unit & integration testing and user acceptance testing. The code apps are also typically mixed code bases with the GIS code being supported by accessory and packaging code like .Net, PowerShell, DB SQL, JavaScript etc.

My Jupyter notebook that bangs up datasets and updates a GIS service with the results = analyst work.
Python is more like a CLI to a bunch of different programs, through the use of internal scripting for some programs and API or library usage for others.

So, if you're scripting a bunch of stuff together, I think of it as "kind of" programming, but if you're building out the underlying tools, libraries, frameworks, etc. I think "developer".

Logging is one of the best ways to identify and track problems. It is no different in the world of APIs. In fact, given the distributed nature of
APIs, the importance of logging and monitoring increases significantly.
To identify problems during the processing of API requests, critical information should be logged. The information for logging should be collected at all stages of message processing and logged at the end of message processing or in the event of an error. Logging can be done to syslog or to a local file system. The ability to log to a local file system is generally available on a private cloud setup of API management platforms. While using a public cloud instance of the API management platform, it is recommended to log information to a syslog server. If syslog server is not available, public log management services such as Splunk, Loggly, Sumo Logic, and so forth, may be used.

Log and time-series management and analytics
onitor and audit data Regularly monitoring and auditing data access is essential for detecting and preventing unauthorized access. Many cloud platforms offer tools for monitoring and auditing data access, such as AWS CloudTrail and Azure Activity Logs. We can also use third-party tools such as Splunk or Sumo Logic to centralize and analyze log data from multiple cloud platforms.

Sumo Logic
Sumo Logic was started in 2010 by former ArcSight engineers to provide cloud-native log management and data analytics. It expanded into the security analytics platform market in February 2020, allowing it to address both security and observability.
1. Strategy. Sumo Logic‚Äôs vision focuses on delivering a cloud-native, AI-driven platform. However, the AI capabilities it has delivered lag the market, as do its roadmap enhancements. It has an on-par partner ecosystem, but its community is small compared with others in this evaluation. It charges per GB and for SOAR and is more affordable than many other tools.
2. Capabilities. Sumo Logic leverages streaming analytics and associates every detection with a single entity, which limits its ability to provide the full context of an incident. It provides useful data in alerts through its timeline feature as well as many prebuilt playbooks and integrations for automation and response. Its case management capabilities are on par with others. It allows control over indicator-of-compromise (IOC) retention, but doesn‚Äôt provide as much context with threat intelligence as others. It‚Äôs especially strong in data management because of its flexibility with multiple use cases and its ability to ingest exabytes of data a day and store data as hot for 90 days by default.
3. Customer feedback. Customers value the flexibility of the offering and its ability to support both security and observability. However, they find it difficult to use without engineering talent. Only one of Sumo Logic‚Äôs reference customers responded to Forrester‚Äôs outreach for this evaluation.
4. Forrester‚Äôs take. Clients who want a technical, cloud-native offering that addresses both security and observability are best suited to Sumo Logic. View Sumo Logic‚Äôs detailed scorecard.

Sumo Logic supports SMB entry-level machine analytics to the largest Fortune 100 companies, creating a wide range of contract opportunities.
Since Google first popularized service-level indicators (SLIs) and service-level objectives (SLOs) as part of their site reliability engineering (SRE) practice, observability tools like Datadog, Honeycomb and Dynatrace started incorporating SLO monitoring into their toolchains. OpenSLO is an emerging standard that allows defining SLIs and SLOs as code, using a declarative, vendor-neutral specification language based on the YAML format used by Kubernetes. While the standard is still quite new,
we‚Äôre seeing some encouraging momentum, as with Sumo Logic‚Äôs contribution of the slogen tool to generate monitoring and dashboards. We‚Äôre excited by the promise of versioning SLI and SLO definitions in code and updating observability tooling as part of the CI/CD pipeline of the service being deployed.
Sumo Logic is a cloud-native data analytics platform that focuses on providing real-time log management, monitoring, and analysis. It collects and aggregates log data from various sources across an organization‚Äôs infrastructure, including network devices, endpoints, cloud environments, and applications.
Sumo Logic‚Äôs security analytics features include machine learning-driven anomaly detection, which helps identify potential security threats and abnormal behavior. It integrates with other security tools, including SIEM platforms, to provide centralized monitoring and support automated incident response workflows.
Sumo Logic
Sumo Logic is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its Observability platform is focused on providing availability, performance and security analysis. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients include enterprise and midmarket segments. Sumo Logic has recently released AI-driven alerting and optimization for anomaly detection. Sumo Logic customers are typically small-to-midsize enterprises and are mainly in the Americas and APAC.
Strengths
Pricing model: Sumo Logic‚Äôs new pricing, Flex Licensing, is based on analytics and not data ingestion. Customers are charged for analytics (data scanning and queries); for example, dashboards, log analytics or monitors. Ingest cost is $0.
OpenTelemetry adoption: OpenTelemetry collection is used to collect telemetry for all new and existing customers. Sumo Logic provides native integrations and updated workflows for leveraging OpenTelemetry.
Points of presence: The platform is available in nine AWS regions across the globe, including North America, EMEA and APAC, to support data residency and data sovereignty requirements.

Cautions
Log centricity: Although Sumo Logic has tracing and metrics capabilities, it is positioned primarily as a log analytics tool. Organizations seeking a tool to provide deep insights into application behavior may be better served by other products in this research.
Market momentum: While Sumo Logic has seen an increase in overall revenue, growth in observability platform revenue has been flat since 2022. This contrasts with a 10% growth in the market at large.
Lack of native synthetic monitoring: Sumo Logic does not offer native synthetic monitoring capabilities. Customers requiring such features must enlist an additional tool to do so. The platform does, however, support out-of-the-box integration to Catchpoint, including prebuilt dashboards.

Exploring Sumo Logic: Cloud-Native Intelligence for Monitoring & Security
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with Sumo Logic, a powerful cloud-native log management and analytics platform. Through my hands-on exploration, I was able to understand how it transforms raw log data into real-time insights for monitoring, troubleshooting, security, and compliance.

‚ú® Here are some key highlights I discovered:
‚úÖ Centralized Log Management ‚Äì Aggregate logs and metrics across systems for unified visibility.
 ‚úÖ Cloud-Native SIEM ‚Äì Real-time threat detection, investigation, and automated incident response.
 ‚úÖ Advanced Analytics & Machine Learning ‚Äì Identify anomalies, trends, and patterns quickly.
 ‚úÖ User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) ‚Äì Spot suspicious activities by analyzing deviations from normal usage.
 ‚úÖ Dashboards & Visualizations ‚Äì Pre-configured panels make monitoring seamless, even without deep technical expertise.
 ‚úÖ Compliance & Security ‚Äì Supports PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, and other standards, ensuring encrypted and compliant operations.

üí° From my testing, I created custom dashboards to track log volume over time, audit event types, and frequent event codes. This not only simplified system health monitoring but also enhanced security auditing and troubleshooting. For example:
1Ô∏è‚É£ A line chart highlighted peaks in event activity (system tasks, logins, scheduled processes).
2Ô∏è‚É£ A donut chart showed audit events breakdown for compliance visibility.
3Ô∏è‚É£ A bar chart revealed the most frequent event codes, helping identify repetitive system actions.

üöÄ What stands out to me is how easy and scalable Sumo Logic is to deploy‚Äîin just minutes, it can start ingesting logs and providing actionable insights. Its integration with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and support for multi-cloud environments make it a complete solution for DevOps, SecOps, and ITOps teams.

In conclusion, Sumo Logic is not just a log collector‚Äîit‚Äôs an intelligent platform that empowers teams to proactively monitor, analyze, and secure their systems. It brings together security, compliance, and operational monitoring into a single, collaborative platform.

Sumo Logic unifies visibility across key AWS services such as Amazon
