I'm like it it it shakes me to my core when we start having like a lot of crashes and then you know and then our response to it is trying to text the users and ask them what they were doing at the time like that is the least effective strategy I could possibly imagine and you know I don't know if they're still doing that but you know I live through that your PG&E it would take us it takes us eight months to resolve a problem it's infuriating I mean I don't think we are taking eight months it sounds like if something like that does happen it's gonna be another case of like a war situation where you know you got Rocky and everybody all hands on deck until until it patches release but that's probably not a very good friend well occasion a change I don't know how I can help you here in this scenario again you're already in my opinion like the early we can get to production a state the end of our state you're gonna be on the line okay yeah yeah and I'm I mean I take what you say very seriously and I'm gonna start working with the team to try to figure out what are our options for production testing because I believe you that that is very much one one avenue to help resolve issues before it becomes a nightmare for everybody yeah let me see I mean I'm sure one experience mass crashing a must the help this type problems I'd expect to experience for release will be edge cases Halo completion completion movies logs to figure out which assets were quarters are giving these problems okay bunch of logs around mismatches with GIS and payloads I don't know more quarters and documents submissions which cover our butts when we're looking for root causes you know John John kind of lives in the world of detailed inspections though and patrols are very very different we don't we kind of disregard like GIS mismatches and just brute force pretend that everything was fine patrols are a lot more casual than a detailed inspection it's primarily that we need to have you know evidence that an inspector was within range to get eyes on every single structure within PG&E once a year and the way that we do that is through a patrol which then records that you know then attesting that they were there at this specific time and that's really what the inspector application does we've had long hard to hard questions with the business saying well there are a lot of discrepancies in GIS that could make it so that you know there's there are assets that exist in the field that are not in the app vice versa assets have been moved assets have been updated and it's really complicated to resolve those and their final determination was because you know patrols are effectively more casual than a detailed inspection we don't need to resolve them so we built in a feature in the app let's say one hypothetical that we think could happen more than we care to admit is that if there are in SAP if there are a hundred assets on a work order but in GIS only 98 of them exist now you've got a discrepancy a few halos that were lit up where there's 98 halos lit up in the inspect app but the SAP is expecting or the application and SAP are both expecting a hundred of these assets to be patrolled and submitted we're because we're not going to be resolving that discrepancy we're faking it and just saying that you know when you do oh there's a feature called mark all patrolled where you can where you can just say every asset on this plat map has been patrolled if you hit mark all patrolled it will make up for that discrepancy and just say cool we got all 100 of them even though there's only 98 halos counted here and the business is totally fine with that okay it was their decision actually I would say you know from what I recommend is you have all this stuff documented in the wiki yeah oh yeah yeah I want to get that in writing and I'm like I need to so we did make sure it's accessible right it's not hiding in somebody's email yeah yeah so listen I have held you hostage for long enough I think this will give me some good guidance on to you know at least your thought process around it and sounds like like John has some pretty good ideas on what should be monitored as well yes so the potentially look at your team right your developers in a few ways you know based on existing stuff that's already been logged you know in Sumo logic if your team needs any help and let's say hey we we're logging this stuff we care about this stuff we need some help with creating some dashboards and or setting some up some alerts so that our team can actually look at it yeah yeah that's that's all part of a bigger support conversation that we're gonna have because we actually we know that we have to be on call starting that first weekend but because we're contracting through PCS we're not sure who those people are that are gonna be able to be on call so we're gonna figure that out exactly yeah that's why I'm considering them separate conversations so okay okay listen I appreciate your help thanks James
